# bookbot

BookBot is a simple project, that takes a book and generates a report with words and characters counters.

To test as if, create a folder called "books" and inside create a text file named "frankenstein.txt", you can also copy and paste the full book as text here(public domain):
```bash
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asweigart/codebreaker/master/frankenstein.txt
```

Finally you can run the project with the command(with Python interpreter installed, version 3 and above): 
```bash
   python3 main.py
```

To generate a custom report simply put the book text file anywhere inside this project folder and update book_path on main.py(line 2) with the book path.
